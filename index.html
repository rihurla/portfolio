		  <h1>Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ricardo, <br><span>iOS Lead Developer</span></h1>
		  <p>
			I am a iOS Senior Engineering Lead with over 13 years of experience in creating and managing iOS applications. It has been an amazing journey, and I look back on it with a real sense of pride and gratitude. <br><br>
			From the early days of iOS development to leading projects for both agile startups and well-established companies, I've had the privilege of building not just products, but also strong relationships and a meaningful professional story. <br><br>
			It's truly incredible to pause and think about the path I've taken, all the things I've learned, the people I've worked with, and the impact we've made together. <br><br>
			I've always put my heart into what I do, doing my best to help teams reach their goals, while staying present and collaborative throughout each project. This journey has shaped who I am today, not just as an iOS developer, but as a teammate and a leader, and I'm genuinely excited for what's still to come.

			<h3>Senior iOS Developer at WorldRemit, London</h3>
			<span class="year">March 2020 - January 2021</span>
			<p>I was part of the iOS Chapter, where I helped develop and maintain core features of the iOS application. As part of this work, I led the creation of a currency conversion widget, enhancing user engagement by adding valuable functionality, and refactored legacy code to improve performance and maintainability. I also contributed to a major redesign across several areas of the app, collaborating closely with designers and other disciplines to ensure a cohesive experience, while supporting the definition of development guidelines to promote consistency and best practices across the team.</p>

			<h3>iOS Developer at Tide, London</h3>
			<span class="year">January 2019 - March 2020</span>
			<p>I led the development of the iOS application within a dedicated squad, focusing on delivering reliable and scalable features. Alongside this, I maintained and refactored legacy code to align with modern best practices and improve overall app stability. I also played a key role in the app's visual and functional redesign, which significantly enhanced the user experience, and developed several core features, including a receipt and transaction matching system that allowed users, particularly business clients, to attach digital receipts to their transactions. During the development process, I worked closely with cross-functional teams and Product Managers to help define feature scope and ensure smooth delivery.</p>

			<h3>Monster - iOS weekly workouts app</h3>
			<span class="year">February 2025 - Ongoing</span>
			<p>I'm currently developing a workout iOS app designed to help users stay consistent with their weekly training routines, whether at the gym or at home. It allows for personalised exercise setup and progress tracking across structured weekly plans. Fully designed and built by me, the app uses SwiftUI and SwiftData, following a clean MVVM architecture alongside the Coordinator pattern for scalable navigation. It also includes a growing suite of unit tests written with SwiftTests to ensure reliability. The design focuses on usability and simplicity, offering an experience tailored to both beginners and more experienced gym-goers.</p>

			<p>I'm mentoring a junior iOS developer on LearnLoop, a flashcard study app, providing guidance on architecture patterns such as MVVM and Coordinator, as well as code quality through SwiftData and SwiftTests. I focus on fostering best practices in Agile development while also offering technical advice, design feedback, and code reviews. My role supports the developer's growth, helping them become a more confident and independent iOS engineer.</p>
