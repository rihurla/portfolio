		  <h1>Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ricardo, <br><span>iOS Lead Developer</span></h1>
		  <p>
			I am a iOS Senior Engineering Lead with over 13 years of experience in creating and managing iOS applications. It has been an amazing journey, and I look back on it with a real sense of pride and gratitude. <br><br>
			From the early days of iOS development to leading projects for both agile startups and well-established companies, I've had the privilege of building not just products, but also strong relationships and a meaningful professional story. <br><br>
			It's truly incredible to pause and think about the path I've taken, all the things I've learned, the people I've worked with, and the impact we've made together. <br><br>
			I've always put my heart into what I do, doing my best to help teams reach their goals, while staying present and collaborative throughout each project. This journey has shaped who I am today, not just as an iOS developer, but as a teammate and a leader, and I'm genuinely excited for what's still to come.
